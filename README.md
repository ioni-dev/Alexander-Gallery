My best friend it's a photographer who loves analog photography, one evening i was thinking maybe it's a great idea to build something for him and of course a website is fantastic.

Coding this website was one of the very formal things i done, facing problems with the DOM and trying to apply diferent solutions, i spend many hours reading documentation and adapting the concepts in my code that i learn so many things, i came to realize that it's a better idea to plan the essential and go for it, code, code, rest, think and code again.
